# Working Plan v2 - evangelista.moe

## Core Concept

A minimalist portfolio centered on "names inform" - the principle that patterns become real when named. This positions Marc as an indie developer with a unique perspective valuable to employers.

## Philosophy Statement

> names inform.

When scattered ideas converge into a pattern, they need a name to exist.
Without the name, they're just things adjacent to each other.
Naming the pattern brings it into being.

This principle drives everything I build - from games about mental patterns to AI systems that recognize information patterns.

names inform
-----------

I'm Marc Evangelista. I recognize patterns and give them names.

Currently building Lilaya - where mental patterns become game mechanics.

Every pattern needs a name to exist
-----------------------------------

[Grid of 5-6 projects, each showing pattern recognition in different domains]

```

### 3. About
```
About
-----

I'm an indie developer who applies one principle to everything:
When patterns converge, naming them brings them into existence.

Started at Bloomberg, where I learned that most "unsolvable" problems 
just needed someone to recognize and name the actual pattern. Now I 
build tools that make invisible patterns visible and nameable.

Whether it's mental patterns in games or data patterns in AI systems,
I use the same approach: recognize, name, transform.

Currently seeking opportunities to apply pattern recognition
at companies building the future of human-computer interaction.

## Visual Design

### Core Principles
- **Minimal**: Let the concept breathe
- **Typography-first**: Words matter when "names inform"
- **Subtle animation**: Patterns forming/crystallizing on hover
- **Monochrome + 1 accent**: Professional but memorable

### Key Animations
- Hero text: Letters crystallize into place
- Project cards: Pattern visualization on hover
- Transitions: Elements "name themselves" into existence

## Copy Voice

- **Concise**: Every word earns its place
- **Concrete**: Patterns, not abstractions
- **Confident**: State what you do, simply
- **Memorable**: "Names inform" as consistent thread

## Technical Implementation

- Astro for static generation
- CSS animations only (no heavy JS)
- Mobile-first responsive
- Fast loading (< 1s)
- SEO optimized

## What This Achieves

1. **Memorable**: "names inform" sticks in hiring managers' minds
2. **Unique**: Philosophy-driven approach stands out
3. **Hireable**: Shows both creative and technical skills
4. **Focused**: Everything serves the core concept
5. **Professional**: Clean enough for corporate, indie enough for startups

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up Astro with minimal theme
- [ ] Implement 4-section structure
- [ ] Basic responsive layout
- [ ] Typography system

### Phase 2: Polish (Week 2)
- [ ] Pattern-forming animations
- [ ] Project card interactions
- [ ] Mobile optimization
- [ ] Performance tuning

### Phase 3: Launch (Week 3)
- [ ] Write final copy
- [ ] Add project images/demos
- [ ] SEO optimization
- [ ] Deploy and test

## Success Metrics

- Memorable after one visit
- Clear value proposition in < 10 seconds
- Leads to concrete opportunities
- Represents both technical and creative skills
- True to personal philosophy while being professionally viable
